Description:
This project focuses on debugging and resolving issues within a web stack environment to ensure the reliability and availability of web services. Through a series of scenarios and exercises, participants will gain hands-on experience in identifying, diagnosing, and mitigating common issues that may arise in web applications, including but not limited to performance degradation, resource exhaustion, and service disruptions.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to equip participants with the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively debug and troubleshoot issues within a web stack environment, ultimately improving the resilience and stability of web services.

Features:

Scenario-Based Learning: Participants will engage in simulated scenarios replicating real-world web stack issues, allowing for practical learning and skill development.
Root Cause Analysis: Emphasis will be placed on identifying the root cause of issues through systematic investigation and analysis of system logs, metrics, and error reports.
Resolution Strategies: Participants will explore various resolution strategies and best practices for addressing common web stack issues, including patching, optimization, and resource management.
Preventative Measures: In addition to resolving immediate issues, participants will learn how to implement preventative measures to mitigate the risk of future incidents.
Collaborative Learning: The project encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing among participants, fostering a supportive learning environment where insights and experiences can be shared.
